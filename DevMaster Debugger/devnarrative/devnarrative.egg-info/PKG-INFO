# DevNarrative - Developer Narrative Logger

Transform your git history into compelling human stories. Perfect for standups, retrospectives, and understanding what really happened.

## 🌟 The Problem

Looking at git history is like reading raw machine logs:
```
a3f7d2c fix bug
b8e4f1a update tests
c9d2a8f refactor
```

**What actually happened?** What were you working on? What challenges did you face? What did you learn?

## 🚀 DevNarrative Solves This

Automatically generates readable stories from your development work:

```
📖 Tuesday, November 5, 2025

Morning Session (9:15 AM - 12:30 PM)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 Main Focus: User Authentication System

You started the day by implementing JWT token validation. After
encountering issues with token expiration, you refactored the refresh
token logic and added comprehensive error handling.

📝 Commits: 8 commits, 342 lines added, 89 lines deleted
🐛 Challenges: Fixed token refresh race condition
✨ Achievements: Complete auth flow with tests

Afternoon Session (2:00 PM - 5:45 PM)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 Main Focus: Database Schema Migration

You tackled the user roles migration, creating new tables and updating
relationships. The process involved careful planning to avoid data loss
and required rolling back once before getting it right.

📝 Commits: 5 commits, 156 lines added, 23 lines deleted
🔧 Technical: Migration scripts + rollback procedures
```
